The Steam games take one argument your players can send it, the world name.

The world name will be used to select which map to start on, if no map selected a default one is chosen.

The world name is also used to control when updates happen, a update to the game will happen on restart of the server whenever the world name is left blank, it will update and load a default map. You can then change the name of the world in Multicraft to a good map name and it will not try to update on the next start.
